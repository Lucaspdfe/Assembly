# BSOS Project

    Hi, i was not expecting anyone here but okay?
    This is my project, i'm just making this for fun. (Forked from: https://github.com/davidcallanan/os-series)
    There's nothing else to say, just that i'm planning to do a linux-like kernel with networking capabilities.
    Note: this kernel is not supposed to be linux compatible, just alike the linux kernel. (but maybe i will do a syscall-only compatible version.)
